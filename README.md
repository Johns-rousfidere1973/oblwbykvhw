Just stumbled out of the theater and God, my back is killing me – those old seats, man. I swear they’re relics from some ancient civilization built to withstand teenage breakups. Anyway, Ask Sadece Bir An – wow. My mind’s still processing. The popcorn's got a vice grip on my shirt. How to even start? It’s like they took a bundle of wires and lit them on fire. Ece, the main character, she’s like a figure skating on the thin ice of reality with scissors in hand!

> Remember when that pigeon flew inside halfway through the  ? Talk about nature providing sound effects. Director probably arranged it. Genius. Ece’s dreams were layered over everything like drenched paper mache, sticking in odd places. Oh, and the scene with the broken clock – time’s like, “I’m optional, guys!”

Everything feels resurrected from a forgotten attic. It’s like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 your grandma's wedding videos in reverse while a cat walks on the piano. Wait, did you ask me earlier if I could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Probably not since it’s still piping hot at the theaters. But I guess someone out there is waiting to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in the cozy comfort of their chaos corner.

The dialogue – or was it a monologue? – where Ece muses over a bowl of lukewarm soup... Existence is my reluctant breakfast. Poetry against the off-tempo orchestra of whispers and crunches from late-night nacho snacking ninja behind me.

> When Ece lay on her bed staring into the invisible abyss, it reminded me of weekends spent lying on the couch avoiding existential taxes. A visual comfy cry. Did I mention there was this crazy kaleidoscope scene? Like spilling all of the universe's secrets but through a blender of color-blind kale? And suddenly you’re thrown into a mad carnival of thoughts where you buy tickets with tears.

Thematically tangled. Emotions grow like ivy, unpruned. One moment liquefies into another until it's all just a shimmering puddle of feels. Ambition took a bite and the apple bit back, leaving surreal seed trails.

Ah, the abrupt ending... felt like someone unplugged a raging waterfall, slap in a meth buzz – no, a drowsy metronome. Still vibrating. Or not. Words fell off as if under gravity’s sleepy spell. Ece's face was that last flicker before the candle surrenders.

—OMG, sorry if this isn't exactly coherent. It's like reaching into a cloudy sky to grab a star and coming back with sticky fingers instead.
